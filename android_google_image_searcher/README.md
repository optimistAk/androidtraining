Android Google Image Search, with Settings Selection
====================================================

The fundamental aspects of this project

1. On submitting a query, gets the top10 image thumbnails and displays them
2. On clicking a thumbnail, opens the full image in a new window (i.e. new activity screen in the app)
3. On clicking the setttings icon (top right-hand corner), and choosing the options for filtering the resuls, this will be captured in the parent activity and subsequently used for all the queries.
